    <h2>Steps to Withdraw XM Bonuses Legally</h2>

    <h3>2. Avoid Early Withdrawals</h3>
    <p>If you attempt to withdraw your funds before completing the trading volume requirement, XM may cancel your bonus. Always ensure you have satisfied all conditions before making a withdrawal request.</p>
    <h3>3. Utilize the XM Partner Code for Extra Benefits</h3>
    <p>By using the <strong>XM Partner Code: CTG8M</strong>, traders can take advantage of additional rebates and cashback incentives, helping them to maximize their earnings while working towards the bonus withdrawal conditions.</p>
    <h3>4. Leverage the XM Rebate Program</h3>
    <p>XM offers an industry-leading rebate program where traders can earn significant cashback for each lot traded. This helps offset trading costs and accelerates your progress toward meeting bonus withdrawal requirements.</p>
    <h3>5. Trade Smartly and Manage Risk</h3>
    <p>Avoid high-risk strategies that could lead to significant losses. Instead, use proper risk management techniques to ensure sustainable trading while working towards the bonus withdrawal conditions.</p>
